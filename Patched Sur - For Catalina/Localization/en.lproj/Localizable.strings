- barrykn: Made the micropatcher that introduced me to the patching process and restored my faith in my really old computer. My hat is off to barrykn, and yours should be too.
- ASentientBot: Made the Hax patches for the installer and brought GeForce Tesla (9400M/320M) framebuffer to Big Sur along with Non-metal Graphics Acceleration patches.
- jackluke: Figured out how to bypass compatibility checks on the installer USB.
- highvoltage12v: Made the first WiFi kexts used with Big Sur
- ParrotGeek: developed the LegacyUSBInjector kext to get USB ports working on some older Macs and figuring out a way to skip the terminal commands when opening the installer app on the USB.
- testheit: Helped with the kmutil command in the micropatcher (that is used in Patched Sur too)
- Ausdauersportler: Integrated patches for iMac Metal GPU support.
- StarPlayrX: Pointed out startosinstall which was later used in the patcher to allow macOS updating support without a USB.
- ASentientHedgehog: Helped randomly along the way
- OCLP Team: Helped with kernel-level stuff for non-Tesla cards for non-metal graphics acceleration.
- dosdude1: OpenGL/GPUSupport swap and of course a whole bunch of patching stuff used in his patcher.
- Bweesh, Bruno Rocha, DutchDK, NickP0is0n, AvaQueen and Finder352 for translating the app.
- John_val, fromeister2009, Mr. Macintosh, Emperor Epitaph, Finder352, Monkiey and AvaQueen for testing some of the new features before release, and pointing out the bugs with them.
- and several others who helped with making Big Sur run as great as it does on unsupported Macs.

Patched Sur also uses two Open Source frameworks, Files and ShellOut by JohnSundell (MIT License), to help handle certain tasks.";

If you're not directly following a tutorial, write these steps down so you know to do them (these are really easy steps, even though it looks like a lot of them):

1. Restart your Mac holding down option until you see some drive appear on screen.
2. Select the yellow or purple EFI Boot. This will immediately shutdown your computer.
3. Turn your Mac back on, holding option again.
4. Select Install macOS Big Sur.
5. Once your Mac boots, select (Re)Install macOS Big Sur again. (It might sound like it, but this will not wipe any user data, it will just upgrade the system files like a standard update)
6. When that app opens, go through the app and select your main volume (probably Macintosh HD, and NOT Install macOS Big Sur)
7. After the update is complete and you see the log-in window, open your Applications folder and launch Patched Sur.
8. Click Patch Kexts, then press Continue and enter your password.
9. After that is done, reboot your Mac and enjoy Big Sur!";
